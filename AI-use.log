[$ts] USER_MESSAGES & ACTIONS:
1) User: Use the attached image... grover progression.  Action: Replaced graph.py with Grover reflection animation (vector + probability bars), generated interactive_graph.html.
2) User: What is n in this example?  Action: Clarified n=6 (N=64).
3) User: Make little n a slider.  Action: Added in-page n slider, rebuilt HTML.
4) User: Rendering shows `}) };`.  Action: Fixed post_script formatting.
5) User: Same issue.  Action: Further fixed template braces; HTML regenerated.
6) User: Add basis-state panel + mean line.  Action: Added third panel with amplitudes and mean.
7) User: y-scale not updating; slider missing.  Action: Autorange y3 in frames; rewired slider init after DOMContentLoaded.
8) User: Fix amplitude y to [-1,1].  Action: Locked y3 range in layout and frames.
9) User: Disable n slider, set n=4, no autoplay.  Action: Removed slider JS, default n=4, pause on load.
10) User: Make amplitude plot ~2x wider.  Action: Adjusted column widths to widen third panel.
11) User: Show vector as arrow.  Action: Swapped line/markers for arrow annotation on state.
12) User: Allow more screen width.  Action: Increased canvas width to 1400.
13) User: Only arrow annotation, no base trace.  Action: Removed base |ψ⟩ trace; arrow via annotations only.
14) User: Label state axis, show prob=amp^2 in hover.  Action: Added x-axis label; hover shows prob.
15) User: Remove “Grover as Sequential Reflections” text.  Action: Cleared subplot title.
16) User: Text “measurement probability...” still shows.  Action: Cleared all subplot titles.
17) User: |x⟂⟩ at origin wrong.  Action: Moved label left of axis.
18) User: Still random |x⟂⟩ at origin.  Action: Removed placeholder annotation; repositioned label.
19) User: Two arrows + label issue.  Action: Removed base arrow; kept frame arrow; adjusted label.
20) User: How easy to switch to JS / Plotly JS.  Action: Provided explanation (no code changes).
21) User: Make new JS version without touching graph.py.  Action: Added grover_js.html (Plotly JS).
22) User: grover_js slider does nothing.  Action: Added Plotly.addFrames after newPlot to wire slider.
23) User: Export messages + summary.  Action: Logged to AI-use.log (this file).
24) User: Can you open grover_js.html and look at it?  Action: Inspected the Plotly demo and noted the amplitude chart x-axis was numeric instead of binary plus general layout observations.
25) User: Fix grover_js.html issues vs interactive_graph.html.  Action: Rebuilt layout/axis anchors and xaxis mappings so probability/amplitude panels render in correct domains.
26) User: Arrow missing on state space and plots unlabeled.  Action: Added visible state arrow annotation and plot titles/axis labels.
27) User: Show past state vectors in different colors.  Action: Added multi-colored history arrows/labels for each iteration in the left plot.
28) User: Two red arrows appear in step 1a.  Action: Removed duplicate oracle arrow so only one dashed oracle arrow is drawn.
29) User: Dashed arrows disappear after they are shown.  Action: Kept previous oracle arrows persistent across later frames.
30) User: Arrow labels sit at origin.  Action: Moved arrow labels to arrow tips via annotations.
31) User: Arrows/labels don’t clear when moving slider backward.  Action: Relayouts full annotations/shapes per frame to avoid stale arrows when scrubbing.
32) User: Add black dashed arrow from tip of state n to state n+1.  Action: Added dashed connector arrows between successive state tips.
33) User: Connectors lack arrowheads.  Action: Swapped connectors to annotations with arrowheads for direction.
34) User: Dashed-origins labels vanish after the step.  Action: Persisted oracle labels by reapplying prior annotations each frame.
35) User: MathJax ket not rendering at grover_js.html:65.  Action: Explained correct \lvert … \rangle syntax and escaping for MathJax.
36) User: Switch annotations to LaTeX where possible.  Action: Converted labels/annotations to MathJax bra/ket and loaded MathJax config.
37) User: Show |+^n> as a solid black vector permanently.  Action: Replaced green reflection line with a permanent black |+^n⟩ arrow.
38) User: |+^n> arrow has two heads.  Action: Simplified the |+^n⟩ arrow to a single arrowhead.
39) User: Arrow still has two heads.  Action: Further cleaned annotations so only one arrowhead remains.
40) User: Add markdown explainer below the figure.  Action: Inserted MathJax-rendered explainer/summary beneath the Plotly graphic.
41) User: \ket/\bra not working; some LaTeX fails.  Action: Patched explainer markup and MathJax usage so bra/ket render properly.
42) User: Provided reference snippet to see rendering issues.  Action: Added full MathJax config and rewired annotations consistent with the reference to fix LaTeX rendering.
43) User: Dynamic LaTeX under the slider isn’t rendering.  Action: Re-typeset opinfo on slider/animation events so changing formulas display.
44) User: Add condensed |ψ_k> expression under before/after lines.  Action: Added slider-driven condensed expression |ψ_k⟩ = (-S_+^± O_f^±)^k |+^n⟩.
45) User: Show \ket{x_\perp} instead of “unmarked subspace”.  Action: Relabeled probability bars to |x_\perp⟩.
46) User: Random annotation toggles between ψ and +^n; remove it.  Action: Removed stray annotation and enforced full annotation replacement each frame.
47) User: Add low-opacity dashed outlines showing previous bars.  Action: Added faint dashed outlines/rectangles for prior probability and amplitude bars.
48) User: Outline current bars in black and add legend for last vs current.  Action: Outlined current bars, kept previous translucent, and added legend groups.
49) User: I don’t see any legend.  Action: Enabled legend display.
50) User: Legend trace 4 should say mean amplitude; remove play/pause.  Action: Renamed mean-amplitude legend entry and removed animation buttons.
51) User: Make previous outlines dashed instead of solid.  Action: Tweaked previous-step bar outlines to use dashed strokes.
52) User: Outlines not visible.  Action: Increased outline contrast/width so dashed previews show up.
53) User: Previous outlines are solid, not dashed.  Action: Tried another dashed-border approach to keep outlines dashed.
54) User: Dashed still not working; see StackOverflow link.  Action: Implemented dashed borders via scatter/shape overlay per StackOverflow technique.
55) User: Revert fills to low-opacity.  Action: Restored translucent fills for previous-step bars.
56) User: Remove pattern; keep solid low opacity.  Action: Removed pattern fills and kept simple translucent previous bars.
57) User: Add prominent text telling users to use the slider.  Action: Added a callout prompting users to explore with the slider.
58) User: Move callout to top and add refresh warning.  Action: Moved callout above the plot and added a refresh-if-glitch warning.
59) User: Make those two separate callouts.  Action: Split into two callouts for instruction and warning.
60) User: Make slider callout blue and warning orange with icons.  Action: Styled callouts with blue/orange colors and icons.
61) User: Add note that this example is a 3-qubit state with marked |0000⟩ but generalizes.  Action: Added note in explainer about the example state and generalization to any qubit count/single marked item.
62) User: Add citations from the provided appendix reference.  Action: Inserted appendix-style citations throughout the explainer.
63) User: Change citations to “(See Appendix A/B)”.  Action: Standardized citation text to the requested “See Appendix X” format.
