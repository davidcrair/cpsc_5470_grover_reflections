# Grover's Search As Reflections - Visualized
#### David Crair's CPSC 5470 Final Project

To view the interactive component of this project, open [grover_js.html](grover_js.html) in any web browser (only tested on Chrome)

My AI use log is located at `AI-use.log`.
I extensively used `gpt-5.1-codex-max` to create [grover_js.html](grover_js.html), which required much prompting on my end. I gave my technical writeup as context and iterated on the results to reach a product that I was satisfied with. Although I didn't write any of the code myself, I am familiar with html, plotly, and javascript, I just wanted to save time and focus more on the visuals and explanation of the quantum computing rather than coding.

I have included a full export of my `cursor` conversations with `gpt-5.1-codex-max` at [full_ai_convo.md](full_ai_convo.md)
